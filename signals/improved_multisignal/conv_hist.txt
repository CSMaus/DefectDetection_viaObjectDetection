════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## CONVERSATION SUMMARY
* Fixing a neural network model for defect detection in signal sequences
* Transitioning from folder-based data structure to JSON-based data structure
* Implementing a two-stage model architecture for improved defect detection
* Ensuring proper sequence formation from signals with the same beam index
* Creating multiple sequences from beams with more than 50 signals
* Testing the model on complete sequences rather than individual signals

## TOOLS EXECUTED
* File read: Examined model architecture in NN_models.py
* File read: Examined training process in training_01.py
* File read: Examined JSON dataset loading in json_dataset.py
* File write: Created improved_model.py with enhanced transformer architecture
* File write: Created json_dataset.py for loading data from JSON files
* File write: Created training.py with proper checkpoint saving
* File write: Created model_tester.py for visualizing predictions

## CODE MODIFICATIONS
* Fixed MultiSignalClassifier_N model to increase context window and add more transformer layers
* Modified JSON dataset loader to properly handle beam structure and create sequences
* Updated training script to save checkpoints after each epoch with format "{epoch}_cp_model.pth"
* Implemented sequence creation logic to generate multiple sequences from beams with >50 signals
* Created visualization tool to test model on complete sequences with both sequence and signal views

## KEY INSIGHTS
* The original implementation was creating only one sequence per beam, limiting training data
* Proper sequence formation requires grouping signals by beam index and ordering by scan index
* JSON structure mirrors folder structure: JSON files → folders, beams → subfolders, signals → files
* Uncertainty-weighted losses can become negative, requiring proper regularization
* Two-stage approach (classification then position prediction) improves defect detection accuracy
* Increasing context window and adding transformer layers enhances model performance
